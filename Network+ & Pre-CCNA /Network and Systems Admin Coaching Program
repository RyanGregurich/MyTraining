Hello world, Ryan Gregurich here….
I recently took an excellent course on Udemy called, “Network and Systems Administrator Technical Training” by Jobskillshare.org. I wanted to share my personal journey by providing a very detailed overview of the skills and knowledge learned.

Purpose: 
1.	CompTIA Network + skills validation and CCNA pre-study.
2.	While the Network+ provided great material, I wanted hands on practice and to fill any knowledge gaps before studying for the CCNA
Tools & platforms utilized:
1.	Udemy course
a.	Network and Systems Administrator Technical Training – By Jobskillshare Community / www.jobskillshare.org
2.	Official JobSkillShare.org Website
3.	Cisco Packet Tracer by Cisco
4.	Test Out labs
5.	Evernote – Notes and 

The course has over twenty-three (23) different sections which includes: lectures, exercises, and hands on demo.
