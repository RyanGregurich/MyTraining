<p style="text-align: center;">Hello world, Ryan Gregurich here.&nbsp;<br><br>I recently completed an excellent course on Udemy called &quot;Network and Systems Administrator Technical Training&quot; by Jobskillshare.org.&nbsp;<br><br>I&apos;d like to share my personal journey by providing a detailed overview of the skills and knowledge I gained.<br><br>I will not only provide a list of the course sections I went through but also create a section on GitHub containing all the exercises and hands-on labs I completed.<br><br></p>
<p>Purpose:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Validation of CompTIA Network+ skills and preparation for CCNA.</p>
<p>2. While the Network+ course provided great material, I aimed to gain hands-on practice and fill any knowledge gaps before delving into CCNA studies.<br><br></p>
<p>Tools and platforms utilized:</p>
<p>1. Udemy course: &quot;Network and Systems Administrator Technical Training&quot; by Jobskillshare Community / <a data-fr-linked="true" href="//www.jobskillshare.org">www.jobskillshare.org</a></p>
<p>2. Official JobSkillShare.org Website</p>
<p>3. Cisco Packet Tracer by Cisco</p>
<p>4. Test Out labs</p>
<p>5. Evernote for notetaking</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The course comprises over twenty-three (23) different sections, which include lectures, exercises, and hands-on demonstrations.</p>
